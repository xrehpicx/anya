//! Paste-burst detection for terminals without bracketed paste.
//!
//! On some platforms (notably Windows), pastes often arrive as a rapid stream of
//! `KeyCode::Char` and `KeyCode::Enter` key events rather than as a single "paste" event.
//! In that mode, the composer needs to:
//!
//! - Prevent transient UI side effects (e.g. toggles bound to `?`) from triggering on pasted text.
//! - Ensure Enter is treated as a newline *inside the paste*, not as "submit the message".
//! - Avoid flicker caused by inserting a typed prefix and then immediately reclassifying it as
//!   paste once enough chars have arrived.
//!
//! This module provides the `PasteBurst` state machine. `ChatComposer` feeds it only "plain"
//! character events (no Ctrl/Alt) and uses its decisions to either:
//!
//! - briefly hold a first ASCII char (flicker suppression),
//! - buffer a burst as a single pasted string, or
//! - let input flow through as normal typing.
//!
//! # Call Pattern
//!
//! `PasteBurst` is a pure state machine: it never mutates the textarea directly. The caller feeds
//! it events and then applies the chosen action:
//!
//! - For each plain `KeyCode::Char`, call [`PasteBurst::on_plain_char`] (ASCII) or
//!   [`PasteBurst::on_plain_char_no_hold`] (non-ASCII/IME).
//! - If the decision indicates buffering, the caller appends to `PasteBurst.buffer` via
//!   [`PasteBurst::append_char_to_buffer`].
//! - On a UI tick, call [`PasteBurst::flush_if_due`]. If it returns [`FlushResult::Typed`], insert
//!   that char as normal typing. If it returns [`FlushResult::Paste`], treat the returned string as
//!   an explicit paste.
//! - Before applying non-char input (arrow keys, Ctrl/Alt modifiers, etc.), use
//!   [`PasteBurst::flush_before_modified_input`] to avoid leaving buffered text "stuck", and then
//!   [`PasteBurst::clear_window_after_non_char`] so subsequent typing does not get grouped into a
//!   previous burst.
//!
//! # State Variables
//!
//! This state machine is encoded in a few fields with slightly different meanings:
//!
//! - `active`: true while we are still *actively* accepting characters into the current burst.
//! - `buffer`: accumulated burst text that will eventually flush as a single `Paste(String)`.
//!   A non-empty buffer is treated as "in burst context" even if `active` has been cleared.
//! - `pending_first_char`: a single held ASCII char used for flicker suppression. The caller must
//!   not render this char until it either becomes part of a burst (`BeginBufferFromPending`) or
//!   flushes as a normal typed char (`FlushResult::Typed`).
//! - `last_plain_char_time`/`consecutive_plain_char_burst`: the timing/count heuristic for
//!   "paste-like" streams.
//! - `burst_window_until`: the Enter suppression window ("Enter inserts newline") that outlives the
//!   buffer itself.
//!
//! # Timing Model
//!
//! There are two timeouts:
//!
//! - `PASTE_BURST_CHAR_INTERVAL`: maximum delay between consecutive "plain" chars for them to be
//!   considered part of a single burst. It also bounds how long `pending_first_char` is held.
//! - `PASTE_BURST_ACTIVE_IDLE_TIMEOUT`: once buffering is active, how long to wait after the last
//!   char before flushing the accumulated buffer as a paste.
//!
//! `flush_if_due()` intentionally uses `>` (not `>=`) when comparing elapsed time, so tests and UI
//! ticks should cross the threshold by at least 1ms (see `recommended_flush_delay()`).
//!
//! # Retro Capture Details
//!
//! Retro-capture exists to handle the case where we initially inserted characters as "normal
//! typing", but later decide that the stream is paste-like. When that happens, we retroactively
//! remove a prefix of already-inserted text from the textarea and move it into the burst buffer so
//! the eventual `handle_paste(...)` sees a contiguous pasted string.
//!
//! Retro-capture mostly matters on paths that do *not* hold the first character (non-ASCII/IME
//! input, and retro-grab scenarios). The ASCII path usually prefers
//! `RetainFirstChar -> BeginBufferFromPending`, which avoids needing retro-capture at all.
//!
//! Retro-capture is expressed in terms of characters, not bytes:
//!
//! - `CharDecision::BeginBuffer { retro_chars }` uses `retro_chars` as a character count.
//! - `decide_begin_buffer(now, before_cursor, retro_chars)` turns that into a UTF-8 byte range by
//!   calling `retro_start_index()`.
//! - `RetroGrab.start_byte` is a byte index into the `before_cursor` slice; callers must clamp the
//!   cursor to a char boundary before slicing so `start_byte..cursor` is always valid UTF-8.
//!
//! # Clearing vs Flushing
//!
//! There are two ways callers end burst handling, and they are not interchangeable:
//!
//! - `flush_before_modified_input()` returns the buffered text (and/or a pending first ASCII char)
//!   so the caller can apply it through the normal paste path before handling an unrelated input.
//! - `clear_window_after_non_char()` clears the *classification window* so subsequent typing does
//!   not get grouped into the previous burst. It assumes the caller has already flushed any buffer
//!   because it clears `last_plain_char_time`, which means `flush_if_due()` will not flush a
//!   non-empty buffer until another plain char updates the timestamp.
//!
//! # States (Conceptually)
//!
//! - **Idle**: no buffered text, no pending char.
//! - **Pending first char**: `pending_first_char` holds one ASCII char for up to
//!   `PASTE_BURST_CHAR_INTERVAL` while we wait to see if a burst follows.
//! - **Active buffer**: `active`/`buffer` holds paste-like content until it times out and flushes.
//! - **Enter suppress window**: `burst_window_until` keeps Enter treated as newline briefly after
//!   burst activity so multiline pastes stay grouped.
//!
//! # ASCII vs Non-ASCII
//!
//! - [`PasteBurst::on_plain_char`] may return [`CharDecision::RetainFirstChar`] to hold the first
//!   ASCII char and avoid flicker.
//! - [`PasteBurst::on_plain_char_no_hold`] never holds (used for IME/non-ASCII paths), since
//!   holding a non-ASCII character can feel like dropped input.
//!
//! # Contract With `ChatComposer`
//!
//! `PasteBurst` does not mutate the UI text buffer on its own. The caller (`ChatComposer`) must
//! interpret decisions and apply the corresponding UI edits:
//!
//! - For each plain ASCII `KeyCode::Char`, call [`PasteBurst::on_plain_char`].
//!   - [`CharDecision::RetainFirstChar`]: do **not** insert the char into the textarea yet.
//!   - [`CharDecision::BeginBufferFromPending`]: call [`PasteBurst::append_char_to_buffer`] for the
//!     current char (the previously-held char is already in the burst buffer).
//!   - [`CharDecision::BeginBuffer { retro_chars }`]: consider retro-capturing the already-inserted
//!     prefix by calling [`PasteBurst::decide_begin_buffer`]. If it returns `Some`, remove the
//!     returned `start_byte..cursor` range from the textarea and then call
//!     [`PasteBurst::append_char_to_buffer`] for the current char. If it returns `None`, fall back
//!     to normal insertion.
//!   - [`CharDecision::BufferAppend`]: call [`PasteBurst::append_char_to_buffer`].
//!
//! - For each plain non-ASCII `KeyCode::Char`, call [`PasteBurst::on_plain_char_no_hold`] and then:
//!   - If it returns `Some(CharDecision::BufferAppend)`, call
//!     [`PasteBurst::append_char_to_buffer`].
//!   - If it returns `Some(CharDecision::BeginBuffer { retro_chars })`, call
//!     [`PasteBurst::decide_begin_buffer`] as above (and if buffering starts, remove the grabbed
//!     prefix from the textarea and then append the current char to the buffer).
//!   - If it returns `None`, insert normally.
//!
//! - Before applying non-char input (or any input that should not join a burst), call
//!   [`PasteBurst::flush_before_modified_input`] and pass the returned string (if any) through the
//!   normal paste path.
//!
//! - Periodically (e.g. on a UI tick), call [`PasteBurst::flush_if_due`].
//!   - [`FlushResult::Typed`]: insert that single char as normal typing.
//!   - [`FlushResult::Paste`]: treat the returned string as an explicit paste.
//!
//! - When a non-plain key is pressed (Ctrl/Alt-modified input, arrows, etc.), callers should use
//!   [`PasteBurst::clear_window_after_non_char`] to prevent the next keystroke from being
//!   incorrectly grouped into a previous burst.
