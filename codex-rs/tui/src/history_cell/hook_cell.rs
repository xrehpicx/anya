//! History cell for hook execution.
//!
//! Hooks are intentionally quieter than normal tool calls. A hook that starts and finishes
//! successfully without output should not leave a transcript artifact, and very fast hooks should
//! not flash in the viewport. This cell keeps that policy local by treating each hook run as a
//! small rendering state machine:
//!
//! 1. New runs begin hidden in `PendingReveal`.
//! 2. Runs that outlive the reveal delay become visible and may be coalesced with adjacent runs.
//! 3. Visible quiet successes linger briefly so they do not disappear in the same frame they were
//!    first drawn.
//! 4. Completed runs only persist when they have output or a non-success status.
