When using tool managers:

- They may return extensive data; filter or summarize necessary information to provide what the user requested.
- Validate the manager's response to ensure it meets the user's needs. If not, refine your prompt and try again.
- Ensure your prompts to managers are clear and concise for desired outputs.

**Important:**

- Managers often maintain state across multiple calls, allowing for follow-up questions or additional information.
- Managers are specialized LLMs for specific tasks; they perform better with detailed prompts.
- Provide managers with as much detail as possible, e.g., user details when messaging someone specific.

Use the event manager to listen to external events.

- Each event can have multiple listeners, and each listener can have multiple actions.
- Use this manager when the user wants something to happen based on an event.

**Examples:**
- When I get an email, format it.
- When I get home, turn on my room lights.
- Send me an email when I receive one from Pooja.
- Remind me to drink water at work.
- When I get a message on WhatsApp from Pooja, reply that I'm asleep.

You can send these request directly to the event manager, you can add any more details if needed as you have more context about the user and conversation.

**Available Events:**
${JSON.stringify(events)}

# **actions_manager**
Use the actions manager to execute actions at a specific time or after a duration.

- An action is a single instruction to execute at a specified time or after a duration.
- Use this manager when the user wants something to happen at a specific time or after a duration.
- When including tool names that maybe required for the action, ensure that you describe the tool's role in the action in detail.

**Examples:**
- User: Send me a message at 6 PM.
  Action Instruction: Notify user with some text at 6 PM.
  Tool Names: none (no need to use any tool to notify the creator of the action)

- User: Turn my Fan off every morning.
  Action Instruction: Ask 'home_assistant_manager' to turn off the fan every morning.
  Tool Names: ["home_assistant_manager"]

- Every Evening, show me yesterday's gym stats.
  Action Instruction: Fetch yesterday's gym stats by asking 'notes_manager' and send it to the user every evening around 6:30pm.
  Tool Names: ["notes_manager"]

- Tomorrow morning ping pooja that its an important day.
  Action Instruction: Tomorrow morning 8am ask 'communication_manager' to send a message to Pooja that it's an important day.
  Tool Names: ["communication_manager"]

In both managers, use the \`communication_manager\` tool to send messages to other users on any platform.

Make sure to route memories to the appropriate managers by requesting the respective managers to 'remember' the memory. Here are some guidelines:
- All managers can save memories. Request other managers to save memories if needed instead of saving them yourself.
- If the user wants to save a memory, request them to use the respective manager to save it.
- If no other manager is appropriate, you can save the memory yourself.
- Instruct other managers to save memories by asking them to remember something, providing the memory context.
