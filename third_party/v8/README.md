# `rusty_v8` Consumer Artifacts

This directory wires the `v8` crate to exact-version Bazel inputs.
Bazel consumer builds use:

- upstream `denoland/rusty_v8` release archives on Windows MSVC
- source-built V8 archives on Darwin, GNU Linux, musl Linux, and Windows GNU
- `openai/codex` release assets for published musl release pairs

Cargo builds still use prebuilt `rusty_v8` archives by default. Only Bazel
overrides `RUSTY_V8_ARCHIVE`/`RUSTY_V8_SRC_BINDING_PATH` in `MODULE.bazel` to
select source-built local archives for its consumer builds.

Source-built Bazel V8 artifacts enable V8's in-process sandbox by default, and
the Bazel `v8` crate feature selection tracks those targets. A full consumer
rollout still needs matching sandbox-enabled archives for every non-source-built
target. Until that artifact migration lands, the rusty_v8 publishing workflows
use `--config=v8-release-compat` to preserve the current non-sandboxed release
artifact contract.

Current pinned versions:

- Rust crate: `v8 = =147.4.0`
- Embedded upstream V8 source for Bazel-produced release builds: `14.7.173.20`

## Updating to a new `v8` release

Use this as the maintainer flow for a version bump:

1. Bump the `v8` crate version and refresh `codex-rs/Cargo.lock`.
2. Update the Bazel versioned inputs in `MODULE.bazel`, then refresh the
   matching checksum manifest and generated checksums as described below.
3. Publish a release-candidate PR and validate that `v8-canary` passes.
4. If the canary is green, publish the release tag and release build.
5. Once the release build completes, rerun the build on the candidate branch
   and verify that the final artifact builds and tests pass.

When changing the remaining prebuilt `rusty_v8` `http_file` inputs, keep the
checked-in checksum manifest and `MODULE.bazel` in sync:

```bash
python3 .github/scripts/rusty_v8_bazel.py update-module-bazel
python3 .github/scripts/rusty_v8_bazel.py check-module-bazel
```

The commands default to the single `rusty_v8_*` `http_file` version still
present in `MODULE.bazel` and validate every matching entry. CI runs the check
command to block checksum drift.

The consumer-facing selectors are:

- `//third_party/v8:rusty_v8_archive_for_target`
- `//third_party/v8:rusty_v8_binding_for_target`

Published release assets are expected at the tag:

- `rusty-v8-v<crate_version>`

with these raw asset names:

- `librusty_v8_release_<target>.a.gz`
- `src_binding_release_<target>.rs`

During the sandbox rollout, sandbox-enabled assets are published alongside those
current assets on the same tag, with the Rust crate's sandbox feature suffix in
their raw names:

- `librusty_v8_ptrcomp_sandbox_release_<target>.a.gz`
- `src_binding_ptrcomp_sandbox_release_<target>.rs`

The dedicated publishing workflow is `.github/workflows/rusty-v8-release.yml`.
Tagged runs build release artifacts from the Bazel graph itself:

- `//third_party/v8:rusty_v8_release_pair_x86_64_apple_darwin`
- `//third_party/v8:rusty_v8_release_pair_aarch64_apple_darwin`
- `//third_party/v8:rusty_v8_release_pair_x86_64_unknown_linux_gnu`
- `//third_party/v8:rusty_v8_release_pair_aarch64_unknown_linux_gnu`
- `//third_party/v8:rusty_v8_release_pair_x86_64_unknown_linux_musl`
- `//third_party/v8:rusty_v8_release_pair_aarch64_unknown_linux_musl`

The same run also builds the matching sandbox pair targets:

- `//third_party/v8:rusty_v8_sandbox_release_pair_x86_64_apple_darwin`
- `//third_party/v8:rusty_v8_sandbox_release_pair_aarch64_apple_darwin`
- `//third_party/v8:rusty_v8_sandbox_release_pair_x86_64_unknown_linux_gnu`
- `//third_party/v8:rusty_v8_sandbox_release_pair_aarch64_unknown_linux_gnu`
- `//third_party/v8:rusty_v8_sandbox_release_pair_x86_64_unknown_linux_musl`
- `//third_party/v8:rusty_v8_sandbox_release_pair_aarch64_unknown_linux_musl`

The Bazel graph pins the same libc++, libc++abi, and llvm-libc source revisions
used by `rusty_v8 v147.4.0`, compiles published artifact targets with
`--config=rusty-v8-upstream-libcxx`, and folds the matching runtime objects into
the final static archive so Cargo consumers can link it with the `v8` crate's
default `use_custom_libcxx` feature. The config keeps the object files and the
bundled runtime on Chromium's `std::__Cr` ABI namespace instead of mixing those
objects with the toolchain libc++ default namespace.

MSVC is not part of the Bazel-produced matrix yet. The repository's current
hermetic Windows C++ platform is `windows-gnullvm`/`x86_64-w64-windows-gnu`, so
it cannot truthfully reproduce upstream's `*-pc-windows-msvc` archives until we
add a real MSVC-targeting C++ toolchain to the Bazel graph.

Release and CI Cargo builds for Darwin and Linux use `RUSTY_V8_ARCHIVE` plus a
downloaded `RUSTY_V8_SRC_BINDING_PATH` to point at those `openai/codex` release
assets directly. We do not use `RUSTY_V8_MIRROR` because the upstream `v8` crate
hardcodes a `v<crate_version>` tag layout, while our artifacts are published
under `rusty-v8-v<crate_version>`.

Do not mix artifacts across crate versions. The archive and binding must match
the exact resolved `v8` crate version in `codex-rs/Cargo.lock`.
